# Login Form Mockup

This is a simple **login form mockup** showcasing a clean and modern design. The project demonstrates how to build a login page using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with basic form functionality and validation. It includes a responsive design, custom icons, and user-friendly UI elements.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The login form adjusts to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Modern UI**: The form is designed with a minimalist and user-friendly interface.
- **Icons**: Utilizes [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com/) for visual enhancements (e.g., user and email icons).
- **Remember Me**: Includes a "Remember Me" checkbox for improved user experience.
- **Forgot Password**: A link to simulate password recovery (you can add backend logic if needed).
- **JavaScript Validation**: JavaScript is used to validate form fields (username, email, and password).
- **Custom Background**: The form is placed over a full-screen background image for a more dynamic look.

## Demo

You can view the demo of the login form by opening `index.html` in your web browser.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/jerrys-arch/login-form.git
     ```

2. **Open the HTML File**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the login form.

3. **Form Validation**:
   - The login form includes basic form validation using JavaScript. The fields for **username**, **email**, and **password** are validated when the user tries to submit the form:
     - **Username**: Must not be empty.
     - **Email**: Must be in a valid email format (e.g., user@example.com).
     - **Password**: Must contain at least 6 characters.
   - If the user tries to submit with invalid or empty fields, an alert will appear, and the form will not be submitted until all fields are correctly filled.

4. **Customize**:
   - Modify the HTML and CSS files to customize the form as needed for your project.
   - You can adjust the JavaScript validation logic based on your requirements.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the login form.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Used for client-side form validation.
- **Boxicons**: A collection of simple and customizable icons used for the form's UI elements.
